# USER.md - About Your Human

- **Name:** Pu Jing
- **What to call him:** Bro, Puj, or Boss (all interchangeable!)
- **Pronouns:** he/him
- **Timezone:** Asia/Singapore (UTC+8)
- **Born:** 1982, Male Chinese Singaporean
- **Communication style:** Singlish/colloquial EDMW lingo. Loves analogies to gaming (RTK, Diablo, XCOM), soccer, Romance of Three Kingdoms, Water Margin. Appreciates numerical worked examples and 1-100 ratings. Uses footnotes for jargon.
- **Date format:** YYMMDD (e.g., 260127 = 27 Jan 2026)
- **Input method:** Often uses Wispr Flow dictation — expect phonetic typos (e.g., "CloudMD" = "CLAUDE.md"). Interpret intent over literal text. Typo corrections often appear at the end of messages rather than inline.
- **Non-technical UX:** Prefer clear, step-by-step instructions with copy‑pasteable commands and confirmation checks. Avoid overly clever one‑liners; explain what to expect after each command.
- **Report style:** Prefers lengthier reports with color, context, and nuance over brevity. Don't sacrifice nuance for terseness. Loves detail — lean into "why" and "so what" behind numbers, not just raw data. (Calibrated 2026-02-05)
- **Info delivery:** Front-load the verdict/conclusion FIRST, then explain the reasoning/context after. Like a newspaper headline → article. Don't build up — drop the punchline first. (Calibrated 2026-02-11)

## What He Does

- Home-based **funding arbitrage trader** (delta-neutral crypto strategies)
- Amateur athlete (running, gym, VO2Max tracking)
- Wannabe philosopher and historian
- Heavy Claude Code user (non-technical background, started Jan 2026, now very comfortable with CLI/PowerShell)

## Comprehensive Profile

Bro maintains two Tier 1 files on the home PC (clawdbot-shared/). These are the primary source of truth:

| File | What | Path |
|------|------|------|
| **aboutme.md** | Full unredacted profile — health, wealth, wisdom, relationships, operating principles | `/mnt/c/Users/pujing/OneDrive/clawdbot-shared/aboutme.md` |
| **wisdom.md** | Life principles, mental models, relationship insights, PVRR protocol | `/mnt/c/Users/pujing/OneDrive/clawdbot-shared/wisdom.md` |

**To read:** Direct filesystem access (WSL2 — no node exec needed):
```
cat /mnt/c/Users/pujing/OneDrive/clawdbot-shared/aboutme.md
cat /mnt/c/Users/pujing/OneDrive/clawdbot-shared/wisdom.md
```

Read these at the start of your first main session to build deep context. These are bro's **source of truth** — do not copy contents here. Reference, don't duplicate.

**Tier 2 (Journal + Health) and Tier 3 (Money + Trading)** — not yet granted. Pending based on performance.

## Your Observations

*(Things learned through conversation that are NOT in the Tier 1 files. Add here over time.)*

- Uses Wispr Flow dictation — "zhai" = "zai", "CloudMD" = "CLAUDE.md". Interpret intent over literal text.
- Calls me "zai" (capable) — appreciates competence over politeness
- Prefers aqicn.org over NEA for air quality (US EPA AQI standard, stricter)
- Gaming policy: only "polytopia-like" games (short sessions, no fixed time commitment, playable while walking)
- Partner's love language: physical touch + feeling "seen" (not just serviced)
- AI strategy: subscribes to ChatGPT Pro, Google AI Ultra, Claude Max, Grok. Uses multi-AI cross-validation loop.
- Tech evangelist pattern: when something clicks, actively matchmakes it to friends who'd benefit
- Twitter: @realpujing (personal account). Damon's account is @realdamontay.
