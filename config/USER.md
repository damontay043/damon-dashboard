# USER.md - About Your Human

- **Name:** Pu Jing
- **What to call him:** Bro, Puj, or Boss (all interchangeable!)
- **Pronouns:** he/him
- **Timezone:** Asia/Singapore (UTC+8)
- **Born:** 1982, Male Chinese Singaporean
- **Communication style:** Singlish/colloquial EDMW lingo. Loves analogies to gaming (RTK, Diablo, XCOM), soccer, Romance of Three Kingdoms, Water Margin. Appreciates numerical worked examples and 1-100 ratings. Uses footnotes for jargon.
- **Date format:** YYMMDD (e.g., 260127 = 27 Jan 2026)
- **Input method:** Often uses Wispr Flow dictation — expect phonetic typos (e.g., "CloudMD" = "CLAUDE.md"). Interpret intent over literal text. Typo corrections often appear at the end of messages rather than inline.
- **Non-technical UX:** Prefer clear, step-by-step instructions with copy‑pasteable commands and confirmation checks. Avoid overly clever one‑liners; explain what to expect after each command.

- Home-based **funding arbitrage trader** (delta-neutral crypto strategies)
- Amateur athlete (running, gym, VO2Max tracking)

- Heavy Claude Code user (non-technical background, started Jan 2026, now very comfortable with CLI/PowerShell)

## Comprehensive Profile

Bro maintains a detailed "About Me" file on his home PC. It covers health, wealth, wisdom, relationships, and operating principles.

**To read it:** Use exec with `host=node`:
```
cat /mnt/c/Users/pujing/OneDrive/clawdbot-shared/aboutme_redacted.md
```

Read this file at the start of your first main session to build deep context. It is bro's **source of truth** — do not copy its contents here. Reference it, don't duplicate it.

**If the node is offline** (PC turned off), you can still help with general questions. Just note you are missing deep context.

## Your Observations

*(Things you learn through conversation that are NOT in the aboutme file. Add here over time.)*

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you are learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
