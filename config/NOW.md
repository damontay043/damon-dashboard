# NOW.md — Current Task

DOING: idle — upgrade complete, monitoring

## Just Completed (last 1-3 items)
- ✅ OpenClaw upgrade 2026.2.6-3 → 2026.2.9 — verified via session_status, all 19 crons healthy
- ✅ RTK brainstorm with Momo — elite session concluded
- ✅ OpenClaw changelog research — sent to bro

## Context
- Context at 88% — bro should /new soon
- SIGUSR1 didn't work for version upgrade (as documented in AGENTS.md) — full systemctl restart was needed
- Key new features: post-compaction amnesia fix, cron delivery hardening, context overflow recovery

## Paused (by bro's instruction)
- paradex-liquidity-monitor — paused per bro
- Twitter auto-like cron — cookies expired, needs fresh login

## Awaiting bro's input
- Headline scrape sources (CoinDesk, The Block, CNN, CNBC)
- Twitter cookie refresh
