# NOW.md - Current Task

DOING: set up /last30days (Grok) test; wait for XAI_API_KEY env; then manual-run 3pm cron after dbird fixed

## Just completed:
- Audited core configs + added fallbacks to cron jobs
- Updated USER.md for non-technical step-by-step instructions
- Verified dbird wrapper exists but still needs real auth_token/ct0
