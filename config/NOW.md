# NOW.md — Current Task

DOING: idle (waiting on bro's pending items)

## Just Completed (last 1-3 items)
- ✅ Coding agent guidelines v4 uploaded to OneDrive for Momo
- ✅ "No Fabricated Data" rule added to AGENTS.md
- ✅ 5pm UV cron updated to use real NEA data

## Blocked On (bro owes me)
- [ ] **Momo's delegation guidelines** — to review and potentially incorporate
- [ ] **Gemini Pro default decision** — shell alias approach? Or other method?

## Context
- Gemini CLI installed + authenticated ✅
- Guidelines at: `/mnt/c/Users/pujing/OneDrive/clawdbot-shared/damon-coding-agent-guidelines-v4.md`
- Nag cron active: `gemini-workstream-nag` (every 3h, 6am-11pm)
- Cross-review pattern works well — used it for the guidelines themselves
- Refer to wife as "the wife" (no specific name/initial known)
