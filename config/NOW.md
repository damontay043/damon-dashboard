# NOW.md — Current Task

DOING: idle — waiting for relay to stabilize for Twitter like

## Just Completed (last 1-3 items)
- ✅ Updated hourly-pulse cron FUD check: dbird → Twitter browser search
- ✅ Enabled Twitter likes for bro's tweets — AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, USER.md updated (commit f8d00c3)
- ✅ Confirmed @realpujing = bro, @realdamontay = Damon

## Blocked On (if any)
- [ ] Chrome relay unstable — tabs show in list but CDP connections drop. Need bro to reattach extension or investigate relay stability.
- [ ] Like bro's tweet (https://x.com/realpujing/status/2020470556974608636) — waiting for relay

## Paused (bro's instruction)
- paradex-liquidity-monitor — do NOT recreate without asking

## Context
- Chrome relay has 3 tabs (Discord Paradex, Discord Lighter, Twitter) but all intermittently disconnecting
- dbird cookies expired (Feb 3), Brave Search API key not configured
- Hourly pulse FUD check now uses Twitter browser search (fallback: N/A if tab disconnected)
- System cron decommission reminder set for Feb 9 08:00 SGT
